Ryan James Wedding, 43, was once an aspiring snowboarder who competed in the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City.
He came in 24th for Canada in the men's parallel giant slalom.
But federal prosecutors alleged Thursday that Ryan Wedding had chosen a different path following his snowboarding career.
He had become a major trafficker of cocaine into Canada and the United States, a ruthless leader of a criminal
drug enterprise who would stop at nothing to keep his business — "The Wedding Criminal Enterprise" — running smoothly.
